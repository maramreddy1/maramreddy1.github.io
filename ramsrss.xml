Â  I asked one woman why she was not wearing a face mask; she stated it interfered with her ability to breathe.Â  Since you do not know this person, you have no idea why they are not wearing one.Â  Since people sometimes lie to suit their needs (i.e. they simply doÂ  not feel like wearing one), you have absolutely no idea whether they are telling the truth or not.Â  I agree that Trump (for whom I will absolutely NOT be voting), should set an example for residents of our country by wearing a face mask.Â  For people to act like Coronavirus does not exist shows the level of ignorance by too many people in this country.Â  They need to stay informed about this pandemic by either watching the news or reading their local paper.Â  I do both. They should think about how their behavior affects other people instead of simply thinking about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family physician was so concerned about my health and about not subjecting me to other people at his office who might potentially have Coronavirus, he did something he has never done before; we chatted over the phone to discuss my current medications and my current state of health.Â  He did something that other doctors should follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that a person who is supposed to set an example for our country should be wearing a face mask and, if a person is able to confirm what Trump states by using Google or another search engine, they should do that in order to protect themselves from his ignorance.&lt;/p&gt; -- SOURCE: http://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2020/bleach-precautions.html]]></description>

         <title>She Watched Mom Decline Through a Nursing Home Window, Then Said Goodbye Via iPad</title>

         <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is a very ill hearted comment! You have no idea what other families capabilities are when it comes to taking care of  an elderly family member. My grandmother is 104 years old. She has been in an assisted living facility for 6 years. She is in a wheelchair, and needs 2 people to lift her out of it and put her to bed. As Well as change her diaper a few times a day. She is also not a tiny woman. My motherâ€™s apartment is not wheelchair equipped. One would not even fit through the front door. My mother is also not well heath wise. She has COPD and a few other issues that would keep her from being able to give my grandmother the care she needs. And I work full time. My grandmother is mentally and physically declining since being on lock down. She is used to us visiting several times a week. She used to be involved in every activity there. Activities with others that she would not get just staying at home with one of us. Activities that keep her mind active. She is now confined to her room. And maybe a push up and down the hallway a couple of times a day. She used to sit outside every day and get some sunshine. These places arenâ€™t even allowing the residents to go outside and get some fresh air. Our hearts are broken here for our family member. For you to get on here and judge others, to try and make them feel guilty is of  not so nice character. And to tell people what they should do legally against a facility without knowing anotherâ€™s circumstance is just plain ugly. I hope you one day realize your comment was not so nice. And maybe be a nicer human the next time you feel the need to post on what others should or shouldnâ€™t do.&lt;/p&gt; -- SOURCE: http://www.aarp.org/caregiving/stories/info-2020/coronavirus-nursing-home-profile-watching-mom-through-window.html]]></description>

Unfortunately, this does appear to be a scam. This email is filled with spelling errors - a telltale sign of a potential scam. Legitimate companies use software to check things like spelling to ensure their emails are professional. Also, a search of "United Pet Transport" comes up with nothing. A legitimate company can normally be found online. I also searched for the crate "Thermal Electronic Crate 088 PD" on Google, and a long list of websites warning people of a scam popped up. I found some articles from known, reputable websites about avoiding pet scams online, and they both mention scammers asking people to pay for special crates. Please read them, I've provided the links below. It is always best to purchase a pet in need of a home from a local shelter. This guarantees they are healthy and legitimate. I hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better Business Bureau (BBB):Â &lt;a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/investigations/14214-puppy-scams-how-fake-online-pet-sellers-steal-from-unsuspecting-pet-buyers-a-bbb-study" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.bbb.org/article/investigations/14214-puppy-scams-how-fake-online-pet-sellers-steal-from-unsuspecting-pet-buyers-a-bbb-study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;International Pet and Animal Transportation Association (IPATA):Â &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ipata.org/current-pet-scams" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.ipata.org/current-pet-scams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; -- SOURCE: http://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-2019/holiday-pet-scams.html]]></description>

         <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;At the very beginning I want to say that I am not speaking directly or in response to Alison's experience.Â  I wasn't there and I don't feel there is enough information offered to have a sense of really understanding the circumstances.Â  Having said that, the death of a loved one is seldom without a great deal of feeling emotional loss, questioning oneself, if death occurs in a facility questioning the facility, and sometimes regret.Â  Where actual wrong or malpractice has occurred an immediate response is needed.Â  However, I would like to add that nursing homes are generally severely underfunded by state and federal government.Â  They are mercilessly scrutinized in some areas and where short comings appear administrators and staff really do want to correct the situation. Without adequate funding appropriate and needful staffing cannot take place. Thus there is a gap in care but not in a commitment to caring for the patient/resident. There is no question that some nursing facilities provide better care than others.Â  But, for the most part there are few long care nursing facilities that are adequately funded. Asking that administrators take the Hippocratic oath will change nothing and assure nothing improves.Â  Increasing funding for training programs, collegial community relationships with hospitals and health care providers, and supportive legislation for funding and care provision are just a few of the ways nursing home care can be improved.Â  If one has a loved one in a facility building trusting relationships before problems occur will assure better care and ongoing communication.Â  Far too many residents are left in the facilities with little more than occasional weekend visits and even less communication with care givers until a problem arises. I realize there are many differing views and opinions that may or may not be supported by these words.Â  But 40+ years of going in and out of nursing home facilities I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly.Â  I have more often seen compassion, empathy, and deep commitment by fellow human beings to the care of loved ones in the facilities. Often these care givers become important family to residents being given care.&lt;/p&gt; -- SOURCE: http://www.aarp.org/caregiving/stories/info-2020/coronavirus-nursing-home-profile-watching-mom-through-window.html]]></description>
